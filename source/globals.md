# Globals

MicroCanvas uses globals to store the game state, as well as the assets (graphics, sounds) and functions (code) required to run your game.


## Why globals?

MicroCanvas usually needs to deal with severely limited hardware configurations that do not allow for abundant memory allocations and large codebases. This both limits the practical size of MicroCanvas programs, and makes it rather impractical to use dynamically allocated memory (as this would degrade performance and risk crashes on devices with really small memory footprint, such as the Arduboy).
